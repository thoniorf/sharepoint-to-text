# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]
## [0.6.0]
- 0.6.0 focuses on reliability and richer extraction coverage: core data types and interfaces now capture tables, images, and formula output more consistently across formats, and extractor behavior has been tightened with broader fixtures and tests to validate real-world edge cases.
- Email handling expands beyond bodies to include binary attachment extraction and downstream processing; attachments now carry MIME metadata, support checks, and can be iterated through the same extractor pipeline when supported.
- A dedicated encryption detection layer now prevents unsupported protected files from being partially parsed, with a consistent exception raised across PDF, modern OOXML, ODF, and legacy Office formats.
- Parser internals for document formats (PDF, DOCX, PPTX, XLSX, ODT/ODS/ODP, legacy DOC) received upgrades to improve table/image handling, formula parsing (OMML-to-LaTeX), and metadata consistency.
- CI and documentation updates round out the release: workflow hardening, expanded test fixtures, and clearer exception documentation to make failure modes explicit for integrators.
